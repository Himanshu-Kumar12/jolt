Hi [Recipient's Name],

The Camunda worker EKS node group is currently not authorized to retrieve the secret for resource ren/rengnp.

I'm running tests in the gnp1 environment at the moment and encountered this issue.

Could you please help grant the necessary permissions for secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on this secret?

Thank you,
